Task1

"Build a simple platform with sign up and sign in functionality. On the platform, there will be three participants. Participant A will be able to see only the message ' Welcome to Goldironhacks.’ Participant B will be able to see only the message 'Welcome to Blackironhacks’. Participant A and B will be able to see the message ' Welcome to Purdue IronHack.'
Use node.js on the backend and javascript/jquery, HTML, CSS for the front end. You can use existing frameworks/libraries. Use either MongoDB or MySQL database.
Ideally, you would submit this solution via github. If not, just let us know how we can access your code."
